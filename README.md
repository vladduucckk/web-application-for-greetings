Example .env file:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

### Key Points:
1. **Cloning the repository**: First step to getting the code onto the local machine.
2. **Setting up a virtual environment**: For isolation of dependencies.
3. **Activating the virtual environment**: Needed to work within the environment.
4. **Installing requirements**: Ensures all necessary libraries are installed.
5. **Environment variables**: Secret keys and email credentials are hidden in the `.env` file, not stored in the code.
